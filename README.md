## Helsinki City Bike App(Dev Academy Pre-assignment)

## Technology Used

### Pragramming Language

#### Python

### Framework

#### Flask,Pandas

### Database

#### PostfreSQL

I have used a condo environment to develop a City Bike application instead of virtualenv. The Conda environment is much smoother than virtualenv and supports most of the dependency itself. To be able to run the project there are some required dependencies that should be installed in env and in the system.

#### 1. Install PostgreSQL on Mac( I am using version 10)
#### 2. Install SQLAlchemy
#### 3. Install psycopg2 inside the env
#### 4. Install Flask-bootstrap
#### 5. Flask and rest of the dependency
